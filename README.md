# WeatherOrNot
Weather updates along your route.

Have you ever taken a long road trip that traversed across many types of terrain, and you were worried that you may encounter snow or rain and be caught unprepared? Weather Or Not takes the guess work out for you, by calculating when you should be crossing certain markers along your travel route, and warns you about weather patterns that you may encounter along your way at the time when you are expected to be passing through.

*Inspired by a solo road trip through the Pacific Northwest.
